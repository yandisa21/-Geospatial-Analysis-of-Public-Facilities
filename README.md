# 🌍 Geospatial Analysis of Public Facilities

This project focuses on analyzing the spatial distribution of public facilities using geospatial data. It aims to provide insights into the availability, accessibility, and clustering of essential public services such as clinics, schools, libraries, and more across a defined region.

## 🧭 Project Objectives

- Clean and process geospatial data of public facilities
- Visualize locations using interactive maps
- Analyze spatial patterns and coverage
- Identify service gaps in urban and rural areas
- Support infrastructure planning and policy decisions
